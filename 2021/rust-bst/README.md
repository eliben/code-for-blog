This repository presents several approaches to implement a binary search tree
(BST) with parent links in Rust. Parent links are an example of circular
references that may exist in data structures.

There are three implementations of the same API here, each using a different
approach as described in the accompanying blog post.

This crate has no dependencies for the BST implementations; it has a dependency
on quickcheck for testing.
