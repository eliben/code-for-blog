This repository collects code samples linked from `my blog
<http://eli.thegreenplace.net>`_. Unless otherwise noted, all the code here is
in the public domain (see the ``LICENSE`` file in this repository for more
details).

I'm making this code available publicly in good faith; note that this does not
mean the code is supported in any way. I'm unlikely to provide significant
support for code in old articles, for example, because sometimes I no longer
have the environment required to run and test the code.
